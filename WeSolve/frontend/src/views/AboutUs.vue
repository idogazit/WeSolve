          What is WeSolve?
        </h2>
        <p>
          WeSolve is a platform for sharing and ranking solutions for university exams.

        <p>
          Our goal is to create a learning community and help students to study better and pass the exams successfully.
        </p>
        <p>
          Students can register to WeSolve, upload solutions to questions from past exams, and watch other studentsâ€™ solutions to the same question.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, students can contribute to the WeSolve community by labeling questions and ranking solutions, in order to improve the studying experience in the website and make it more accurate and efficient.

        <h2>
          Why WeSolve?
        </h2>
        <p>
          As university students during COVID-19, creating study groups for exams became more difficult since students were not physically in the campus, so making new connections with other students was hard.
        </p>
        <p>
          WeSolve intends to fill this gap and make the studying experience a little bit more social and cooperative.
